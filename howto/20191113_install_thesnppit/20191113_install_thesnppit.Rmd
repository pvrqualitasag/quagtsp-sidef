# Requirements and Problems
From the documenatation given in the user [guide](https://tsp-repo.thesnppit.net/resources/TheSNPpit-user-guide-latest.pdf), it is clear that TheSNPpit (TSP), as it comes out of the box, is a program that is targetted towards running on a single machine and is not constructed for a distributed setup. This means that there is one instance of the database-server and one installation of the client programs that accesses the data in the database. Different users on the same machine can use the client programs which can all interact with the given instance of the database on the same machine.

```{r base-installation-thesnppit, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/base-installation-thesnppit.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/base-installation-thesnppit.png")
```


It gets more complicated if we want to be able work with the same data from different machines. This requires to get access to the database-server from different clients running on different machines. This requires a distributed setup over different machines. 

```{r distributed-installation-thesnppit, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/distributed-installation-thesnppit.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/distributed-installation-thesnppit.png")
```


A further requirement for using the provided installation infrastructure is that root access is available on the machine where TSP is to be installed. In most High-Performance-Computing (HPC) environments, this requirement is not met. On an HPC-machine every user has a login account with restricted permissions. For the zws-servers at Qualitas AG, all users access the servers via the common account `zws` which does not have root-priviledges. Hence, with respect to the installation of TSP, we are in an HPC-scenario.

As a consequence of the above described points, the automatic installation script given in the tarball from TSP cannot be used. In what follows, strategies for solving the above mentioned problems are developed and described.


# Strategy
Different strategies to solve the above described problems can be envisaged. The different strategies are characterized by different levels of complexity and offer different functionalities. In summary the following strategies can be layed out.

1. Simple one machine installation of TSP. This solution has a low level of complexity, but it does offer the functionality of using TSP software from only one machine.
2. Distributed setup where TSP client software can be used from different machines. This solution corresponds to a distributed setup which is more complex but it does offer the functionality of using TSP software from different machines.
3. Replication of the pg-database instance that is used by the TSP client from one master to several slave instances. 

In a first step, the TSP system is installed following strategy 1. That means, the complete system is installed on a single machine. Together with the container based context of the zws-servers, the installation is done in a separate container image.

In what follows the manual installation procedure described in the guide of TSP is followed to produce a single-machine installation in a container image.


# Installation
## User Guide
The installation of TSP is described in Chapter 6 of the user guide available at https://tsp-repo.thesnppit.net/resources/TheSNPpit-user-guide-latest.pdf. The general installation procedure consists of downloading and unpacking the tar-ball into the directory `/usr/local/TheSNPpit_current`. TSP is installed via the script `bin/install`. This installation requires root priviledges and hence cannot be used in an HPC-environment.

## Manual Installation
In section 6.3 of the user guide a manual procedure is described. This manual installation procedure consists of the following four steps. 

1. system software installation
2. database configuration
3. TheSNPpit software installation
4. testing

## System Software Installation
In Listing 57 of the user guide, the shell-commands to install the software dependencies of TSP are shown. In essence the dependencies of TSP are the 'gcc' compiler, the 'perl' interpreter and the 'postgresql' database together with additional libraries. The complete set of required software components are included into the singularity-recipe file that is used to build the singularity container image. 

## Database Configuration
The database configuration is developed by initialising a database instance from the local user that is supposed to be running the container image containing TSP. Before the initialisation of the database, the local TSP-working-directory infrastructure must be created. 

```
TSPWORKDIR=/home/zws/tsp
/home/zws/simg/quagtsp-sidef/bash/init_tsp_workdir.sh -w $TSPWORKDIR -f
```

The created directories are then used to initialise a pg-db instance.

```
TSPWORKDIR=/home/zws/tsp
DATADIR=${TSPWORKDIR}/pgdata
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/initdb -D $DATADIR -A trust -U zws
```

The 'initdb' command creates a set of files including the configuration files 'pg_hba.conf' and 'postgresql.conf'. These configuration files must be adapted depending on the parameters of the local installation of TSP. Once the database configuration is completed, the pg-db server can be started with the command shown below.

```
TSPWORKDIR=/home/zws/tsp
DATADIR=${TSPWORKDIR}/pgdata
LOGDIR=${TSPWORKDIR}/pglog
LOGFILE=${LOGDIR}/`date +"%Y%m%d%H%M%S"`_pg_logfile.log
/usr/lib/postgresql/10/bin/pg_ctl -D $DATADIR -l $LOGFILE start
```

For TSP the additional db-admin named 'snpadmin' must be created using the 'createuser' command. 

## Installation of TheSNPpit Software
The TSP software installation is included in the singularity recipe file. For TSP, the installation just consists of downloading the tar-ball from the download-page and then un-tarring the downloaded file into the correct bath. 

## Testing
The TSP installation is tested with two sets of testing suites. The first set consists of the regression tests contained in the script 'install_testdb'. The second set of tests are the interactive commands which can be produced by the script 'demo.bat'.


# Implementation
The installation of the system software and of the TSP-software is done via the singularity recipe file. The database configuration and the testing procedures are implemented in a script named 'post_install_tsp_sa.sh'.
